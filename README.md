# HeliStat

HeliStat is a little database tool to record movements (arrivals and departures) at small heliports.
It is normally operated by air traffic controllers or aerodrome / heliport operators for recording movements and generate statistics (Excel export).

With this program it is possible to record helicopter arrivals and departures with corresponing landing and arrival times and other details.
Furthermore, a database with individual helicopters can be maintained to have them available all the time for recording movements.
Operators and aircraft types can be assigned to the individual helicopter registration, so as to have statistics related to the individual operators (for sending
bills to the operator).
A function to export all the statistics (per year or day) into an Excel file is one of the main features of this tool.

It is my first software project so far and not very professional as I am only a hobby programmer :)
I do all the work in my leisure time and I am teaching C# myself. This was a good project to test my new skills.

Project is still work in progress and not (or will never be..) finished..
